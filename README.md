# alters-project
A fun little project exploring the concept of alternate personas.

The Alters Project is an appendix to the RIPT novel universe created by Joel Rhine. The purpose of this project is to help readers wrap their mind around the concept of split personalitiesâ€“other known names for this phenomenon are: "Manchurian Candidate", "Alter Egos", or "Alters". Some may even consider schizophrenia to be a form of split personalities.
